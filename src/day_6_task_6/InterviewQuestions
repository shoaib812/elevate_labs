1. What is Swing?
Swing is a Java GUI toolkit (part of javax.swing package) used to build desktop applications.
It’s lightweight, platform-independent, and built on top of AWT but offers more advanced and
flexible components like JButton, JTable, and JTree.


2. Difference between AWT and Swing?
Feature	AWT	Swing
Dependency	Uses native OS components	Pure Java implementation
Look & Feel	Platform-dependent	Pluggable Look & Feel
Components	Limited set	Rich set (tables, trees, sliders, etc.)
Performance	Faster (uses OS resources)	Slightly slower but more flexible
Thread Safety	Not thread-safe	Must run on EDT (Event Dispatch Thread)


3. What is ActionListener?
An interface in java.awt.event used to handle button clicks or similar actions.
It has one method:
void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)
You implement it to define what should happen when a user performs an action (like clicking a button).


4. How to manage layouts in Java?
Java provides layout managers to arrange components:
FlowLayout – places components in a row.
BorderLayout – divides into North, South, East, West, Center.
GridLayout – places components in equal-sized grid cells.
BoxLayout – arranges components in a row or column.
null layout – manual positioning (setBounds).


5. What is the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT)?
The EDT is the special thread responsible for handling all GUI-related events (drawing UI, responding to clicks).
All Swing UI updates must be done on this thread using:
SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> { /* update UI */ });


6. What are the GUI components in Java?
Common Swing components:
JFrame – main window
JButton – button
JLabel – text display
JTextField – single-line text input
JTextArea – multi-line text input
JCheckBox, JRadioButton – options
JTable, JList – lists and tables
JScrollPane – scrollable container


7. How to handle multiple events?
Register different listeners for different components.
Use ActionCommand to distinguish actions in the same listener:
button1.setActionCommand("ADD");
button2.setActionCommand("DELETE");

Inside actionPerformed() check:
if (e.getActionCommand().equals("ADD")) { ... }


8. What is JPanel vs JFrame?
JFrame → The main window (top-level container).
JPanel → A sub-container inside JFrame to group components.
Example: You can have multiple panels inside a frame for different sections.


9. How to add scroll bar in GUI?
Wrap the component inside JScrollPane:
JTextArea textArea = new JTextArea(20, 50);
JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(textArea);
frame.add(scrollPane);
This automatically adds scroll bars when needed.


10. What is MVC architecture?
MVC stands for Model–View–Controller:
Model – Data and business logic
View – UI elements (e.g., Swing components).
Controller – Handles user actions and updates Model & View.
In Swing, separating MVC helps keep code modular and maintainable.
